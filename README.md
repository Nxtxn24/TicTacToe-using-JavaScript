# TicTacToe-using-JavaScript
A basic TicTacToe application built using Node.JS

This is a basic TicTacToe game built entirely using NodeJS. Simply clone the repository, or copy the code from index.js into a file of your own and 
run "node <filename>" in your command prompt.

The game would load up and is playable between two players. It would terminate as soon as one of the players would get three in a row.

Hope you like it. Enjoy :)
